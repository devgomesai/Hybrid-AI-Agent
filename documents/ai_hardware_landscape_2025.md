- Orchestration, placement, and memory bandwidth dominate real-world performance.

## NVIDIA – Hopper to Blackwell

- Hopper (H100/H200): strong FP8/FP16 throughput and transformer engine.
- Blackwell generation: higher throughput, improved memory bandwidth, and FP4/FP6 modes.
- NVLink scale-up: larger GPU pods with low-latency collective ops.
- Grace-Blackwell superchips: tighter CPU-GPU coupling for memory-bound workloads.
- Software moat: CUDA stack, NCCL, Triton, and NeMo continue to dominate.

## AMD – MI300 and Beyond

- MI300 accelerators: competitive BF16/FP16, strong memory capacity.
- ROCm maturity: tooling reliability improves; broader framework support.

## Custom Silicon and NPUs

- Cloud Providers: bespoke inference ASICs optimize cost and latency for popular ops.
- Apple/Qualcomm/Intel: on-device NPUs accelerate private, low-latency AI features.
- Edge AI: power constraints push quantization and novel memory hierarchies.
- RISC-V accelerators: niche growth for specialized, open instruction sets.

## Memory, Storage, and Bandwidth

- HBM3e: critical for training; capacity and bandwidth dictate model parallelism.
- CXL: memory pooling enables flexible capacity allocation across nodes.
- NVMe/Storage: dataset streaming pipelines minimize idle GPU time.
- Checkpointing: efficient sharded writes reduce recovery overheads.
- Prefetch: overlap IO and compute to keep accelerators saturated.

## Networking and Interconnects

- 800G/1.6T Ethernet: merchant silicon reaches AI cluster backbones.
- Infiniband: still favored for low-latency collectives in the largest pods.
- Topologies: fat-tree, dragonfly, and torus each trade cost vs. bisection bandwidth.
- Collective Offloads: SHARP-like features reduce all-reduce overhead.

## Power, Cooling, and Density

- Liquid cooling adoption accelerates; rear-door heat exchangers and direct-to-chip loops.
- Power envelopes push site-level upgrades; utility contracts and modular datacenters.
- Sustainability: PUE improvements plus dynamic load shifting to greener grids.
- Thermal Design: board-level hotspots drive packaging and materials advances.

## Software Stack Considerations

- Compilers: PyTorch Inductor, XLA, TVM, and Triton kernels for portability.
- Schedulers: cluster-level placement to minimize cross-node communication.
- Observability: GPU telemetry, kernel-level profiling, and network tracing.
- Checkpoint Formats: safetensors and FSDP-compatible shards.
- Runtime: CUDA graphs and graph capture to reduce launch overhead.

## Inference at Scale

- Speculative decoding and assisted generation reduce latency and GPU time.
- Quantization: INT8/INT4 with calibration preserves quality for common tasks.
- KV Cache: memory optimization is often the dominant lever for throughput.
- Graph capture: runtime compilation to fuse ops and reduce dispatch overhead.
- Sharded Serving: tensor/sequence parallelism plus load-aware routing.

## Cost and Capacity Planning

- GPU-hour pricing volatility persists; commit contracts hedge supply risk.
- Rightsizing: mix of A/B tiers for training vs. inference economics.
- Model lifecycle: train on premium, serve on cost-optimized accelerators.
- Utilization: priority queues and elastic batch sizing lift effective throughput.
- SLOs: define acceptable latency bands per route to prevent overprovisioning.

## Edge and On-device Trends

- Offline-first: privacy and latency benefits for consumer and industrial.
- TinyML resurgence: distilled models with task-specific accelerators.
- Federated fine-tuning: secure aggregation with differential privacy.
- Thermal Budgets: NPU workloads adapt to mobile device power states.

## Practical Checklist for Infra Teams

- Define target latency and throughput per workload class.
- Size HBM and interconnects from those SLOs, not the other way around.
- Plan for failure: hot spares, fast rehydration, and zonal diversity.
- Instrument everything: kernel traces to application SLIs.
- Standardize model packaging for portability across clusters.
- Benchmark Realistically: include IO, preprocessing, and retries.

## What to Watch in 2025

- Supply chain: HBM availability and substrate capacity.
- Interconnect wars: Ethernet with AI features vs. Infiniband.

- PUE: Power Usage Effectiveness for datacenters.
- FSDP: Fully Sharded Data Parallel.
- NCCL: NVIDIA Collective Communications Library.

## Closing Note

- Winning stacks pair the right silicon with disciplined software and ops.
- Efficiency and reliability win more than peak FLOPs on a spec sheet.

## Case Studies (Sketch)

- Training LLM 70B: cluster of 1K accelerators, HBM-bound; optimize sequence length, gradient checkpointing.
- Multimodal 20B: bandwidth-sensitive; prioritize NVLink scale-up over scale-out to reduce all-to-all.
- Inference fleet: KV cache pinning in HBM; route long-context queries to higher-memory tier.

## Benchmarking Guidance

- Use end-to-end pipelines, not microbenchmarks alone.
- Include tokenization, feature extraction, and postprocessing in timing.
- Report p50/p95 latency, cost per 1K tokens, and energy per query.
- Capture failure/timeout rates and retry overhead.

## Procurement Checklist

- Availability: lead times for GPUs, HBM, and NICs.
- Interop: firmware, drivers, and virtualization compatibility.
- Support: kernel patches cadence and security update SLAs.
- TCO Model: power, cooling, floorspace, and staff costs included.

## Capacity Burst Strategies

- Cloud spillover: encrypt checkpoints; validate kernels on both stacks.
- Mixed precision profiles: tune per model family and task.
- Elastic batching: adaptive batch sizing within SLO envelopes.

## Reliability Patterns

- Fast requeue on kernel failures; isolate bad nodes quickly.
- Checkpoint little and often; verify restore on staging weekly.
- Canary new drivers; gate rollouts with perf and error budgets.

## Security Considerations

- Firmware signing and attestation for accelerators.
- Network segmentation; restrict east-west management plane.
