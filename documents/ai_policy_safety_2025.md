## Key Regulatory Themes

- Risk-tiered obligations that scale with capability and deployment context.
- Evaluations as a gate: pre-deployment testing, post-deployment monitoring, and recalibration.
- Supply chain transparency: model cards, data provenance, and inference-time disclosures.
- Incident reporting: standardized definitions for harm, near-miss, and systemic risk events.
- Accountability: designated AI governance officers and board-level risk committees.

## EU AI Act – Practical Impacts

- Scope: providers, importers, distributors, and deployers of AI systems affecting the EU market.
- Categories: prohibited, high-risk, limited-risk, minimal-risk systems.
- Conformity Assessment: technical documentation, quality management systems, and post-market surveillance.
- Data Governance: representative, free of errors as far as possible, and appropriate for context.
- Transparency: user notifications for emotion recognition, biometric categorization, and deepfakes.
- Penalties: significant administrative fines proportionate to company global turnover.
- Foundation Models: systemic-risk models face extra obligations tied to compute and capability thresholds.

## UK Approach – Pro-innovation with Assurance

- Regulator coordination via a central body to avoid conflicting requirements.
- Model evals integrated into an assurance sandbox with sector-specific pathways.
- Guidance emphasizes socio-technical testing: bias, robustness, privacy, and misuse potential.
- Procurement lever: government buyers require assurance claims with evidence and third-party attestations.
- Incident Sharing: confidential channels for reporting capability hazards and misuse signals.

## United States – NIST, Sectoral Oversight, and Reporting

- NIST AI Risk Management Framework updated with evaluation profiles for agents and multimodal systems.
- Sector regulators (FDA, CFPB, SEC, DOT) publish domain-aligned AI oversight advisories.
- Compute Reporting: voluntary disclosures on training runs over defined FLOP thresholds.
- Incident Taxonomy: standardized severity levels and time-bound notification expectations.
- Liability Focus: deceptive AI disclosures and unfair or abusive practices flagged for enforcement.

## Frontier Safety and Compute Governance

- Safety Cases: providers articulate hazards, mitigations, and residual risk before release.
- Red Teaming: adversarial testing for jailbreaks, cyber-physical risk, and bio/chemical assistance.
- Evals Portfolio: capability, alignment, tool-use, autonomy, resilience, and societal impact metrics.
- Compute Thresholds: triggers for pre-registration and third-party review when crossing FLOP limits.
- Synthetic Data: controls for self-training feedback loops and risk of capability amplification.

## Model Transparency and Content Integrity

- Model/Release Cards: standardized sections for training data scope, limitations, and misuse.
- Watermarking: provenance at generation time plus robust detection methods for distribution channels.
- Cryptographic Provenance: C2PA adoption expands across media platforms and productivity suites.
- Disclosure UX: consistent language for AI-assisted outputs across consumer and enterprise tools.
- Privacy Controls: data deletion, opt-outs, and confidential computing for sensitive workloads.

## Audits, Assurances, and Certifications

- First-party Assertions: structured claims mapped to recognized assurance frameworks.
- Third-party Assessments: accredited bodies conduct audits for high-risk and systemic models.
- Continuous Assurance: telemetry-informed attestations that update with model changes.
- Open Artifacts: shareable evaluation datasets and red-team prompts for reproducibility.
- Supply Chain: attestations flow from model providers to application developers to customers.

## Corporate Governance and Board Duties

- Board Oversight: AI risk as a standing agenda item with quantified risk reporting.
- RACI Models: clear ownership for data, model, platform, and product risk controls.
- KPIs: incident rates, mitigation time-to-close, bias drift, and eval coverage.
- Compensation: tie leadership rewards to safe deployment and compliance milestones.
- Training: mandatory role-based AI risk education across engineering and go-to-market.

## Law Enforcement and National Security Considerations

- Dual-use dilemmas addressed with tiered access controls and monitored tool-use APIs.
- Export Controls: coordination on advanced accelerator hardware and model weights sharing.

## Cross-border Coordination

- G7/OECD alignment on evaluation taxonomies and incident definitions.
- Mutual Recognition: toward recognizing equivalent conformity assessments.
- International Sandboxes: share red-team insights while preserving sensitive details.

## Practical Checklist for Builders (2025)

- Map systems to risk tiers; document rationale and controls.
- Establish an evaluations plan covering pre- and post-deployment.
- Implement incident detection, severity classification, and reporting playbooks.
- Maintain model cards, data statements, and update logs.
- Adopt provenance tech (watermarking/C2PA) where appropriate.
- Set board reporting cadence with quantitative safety KPIs.

## Emerging Debates to Watch

- What counts as systemic risk and who decides thresholds?
- Balancing transparency with security (red-team prompt disclosure risks).
- Rights of data subjects vs. model performance in retraining.
- Global compute governance vs. national industrial policy priorities.
- Agent autonomy controls and limits in enterprise environments.

## Sector Spotlights

- Healthcare: real-world performance monitoring and documentation for clinical decision support.
- Finance: model-risk management integration with stress scenarios and human-in-the-loop.
- Education: transparency for adaptive learning tools and data minimization.
- Industrial: safety interlocks for robotics and cyber-physical systems.
- Media: content provenance, licensing, and synthetic persona disclosures.

## Incident Reporting Template (Sketch)

- Summary: what happened, when, and who/what was affected.
- Severity: classification and business impact.
- Root Causes: technical and organizational contributors.
- Mitigation: immediate steps and longer-term fixes.
- Recurrence Prevention: monitoring and policy updates.

## Key Terms

- Systemic-Risk Model: capability level with potential for broad harm if misused or misaligned.
- Safety Case: structured argument with evidence for acceptable residual risk.
- Post-market Surveillance: monitoring and response after deployment.
- Assurance Claim: testable statement about system properties backed by evidence.

## Closing Note

- The direction is clear: evaluation-first, evidence-backed AI governance.
- Organizations that operationalize assurance will move faster with fewer surprises.

## FAQs (Policy Teams)

- How do we scope a model as systemic-risk? Use capability thresholds, eval scores, and compute spent.
- Do we need third-party audits? For high-risk in many jurisdictions, yes or strong equivalent.
- What about open weights? Document release rationale and apply misuse monitoring where lawful.
- Are red-team artifacts public? Share summaries; avoid dual-use sensitive prompts when risky.

## Minimal Artifacts Bundle

- Model Card: overview, training data notes, limitations, misuse.
- Data Statement: collection sources, rights, sensitive categories handling.
- Evaluation Report: methods, datasets, metrics, limitations.
- Incident Runbook: triage flow, severity matrix, contacts, comms templates.
- Change Log: versions, mitigations added, capability changes.

## Board Questions to Ask Quarterly

- Are we meeting evaluation coverage targets for critical systems?
- What top risks moved up or down, and why?
- Are incident response SLAs being hit, and where are bottlenecks?
- Any regulatory horizon issues that require design changes now?

## Template: Safety Case Skeleton

- Context: system purpose, users, environments.
- Hazards: list, likelihood, severity, detection.
- Controls: preventive, detective, corrective.
- Evidence: tests, audits, monitoring, incidents closed.
- Residual Risk: acceptance rationale and sign-offs.

## Practical Adoption Notes

- Start with one product line; build artifacts, then scale to others.
- Automate evidence collection where possible (CI, telemetry).
- Align legal, security, and engineering on shared definitions.
- Prefer iterative approvals over one big-bang review at launch.
