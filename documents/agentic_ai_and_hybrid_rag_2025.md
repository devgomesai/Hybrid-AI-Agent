# Agentic AI and Hybrid RAG – 2025 Field Guide

## Executive Summary

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation evolves into retrieval-and-tool-use with multi-step planning.
- Orchestrators coordinate tools, memory, and evaluators; observability moves from logs to traces.
- Enterprise adoption hinges on safety rails, provenance, and measurable ROI.

## System Architecture Patterns

- Planner-Executor: LLM plans sub-tasks, dispatches to tools, and verifies results.
- Graph Agents: nodes represent capabilities; edges encode control and data flow.
- Hybrid RAG: dense + sparse retrieval, plus structured retrieval from graphs and SQL.
- Memory Layers: short-term conversation, long-term vector, and episodic task memories.
- Offline Evaluators: scheduled runs score correctness, latency, and robustness.

## Retrieval Best Practices

- Data Freshness: schedule ingestion, deduplication, and drift monitoring.
- Chunking: semantic, hierarchical, and table-aware strategies outperform naive splits.
- Hybrid Search: BM25 + dense embeddings + metadata filters for recall and precision.
- Re-ranking: cross-encoder or late-interaction for top-k refinement.
- Source Attribution: cite documents with stable identifiers and anchors.

## Tool Use and Function Calling

- Tool Specs: typed inputs/outputs with strict validation and timeouts.
- Idempotency: retries safe by design to avoid duplicate side effects.
- Caching: memoize results of deterministic tools with bounded TTL.
- Side-channel Controls: redact secrets and PII before tool invocation.

## Planning and Self-Reflection

- Chain-of-Thought Alternatives: structured plans without exposing raw reasoning.
- Self-Verification: generate critiques and targeted re-queries for missing info.
- Debate/Ensemble: multiple agents with diverse prompts converge via voting.
- Hallucination Guards: answer abstention and defer-to-human when confidence is low.

## Observability and Evaluation

- Tracing: spans for retrieval, tools, model calls; propagate correlation IDs.
- Test Suites: golden questions with expected sources and acceptance thresholds.
- Live Metrics: precision@k, groundedness, latency distributions, and cost per run.
- Incident Review: capture prompts, states, and artifacts for reproducibility.

## Security and Safety

- Prompt Injection Defense: content filters, allowlists, and tool-side input sanitization.
- Data Exfiltration: constrain filesystem and network access for tools.
- Guardrails: regular expressions, classifiers, and policy engines on inputs/outputs.
- Quotas: per-user and per-tenant limits to contain abuse and runaway costs.

## Multimodal Agents

- Vision + Text: OCR-free reasoning over UI screenshots and diagrams.
- Audio: streaming ASR with incremental reasoning and barge-in handling.
- Actions: UI automation with accessibility tree alignment and recovery steps.

## Enterprise Rollout Strategy

- Pilot Narrowly: choose a bounded task with measurable success metrics.
- Shadow Mode: observe agent suggestions before granting write permissions.
- Access Control: scope tools and data to least privilege.
- Acceptance Criteria: define abstention rules and escalation paths.

## Hybrid RAG Implementation Notes

- Index Types: vectors, keyword, relational, and graph indexes; pick per question type.
- Enrichment: entity linking, schema extraction, and document-level metadata.
- Chunk Linking: bidirectional anchors to reconstruct context without duplication.
- Query Planning: decompose questions and dispatch to indexes selectively.

## Performance Tips

- Batch and Stream: batch retrieval; stream model tokens for low perceived latency.
- KV Cache: reuse context across tool-augmented steps where safe.
- Compression: lossy summaries for long-term memory; lossless for legal/finance.
- Cost Controls: route to smaller models for easy tasks; escalate only when needed.

## Common Failure Modes

- Over-Chunking: fragments that lose global coherence.
- Under-Instrumentation: no traces → hard to debug or improve.
- Tool Mis-specification: ambiguous params cause cascading errors.
- Eval Blind Spots: tests that ignore rare but critical edge cases.

## Governance and Risk Management

- Model Registry: track versions, training data notes, and eval scores.
- Change Management: require approvals for new tools and capability expansions.
- Incident Taxonomy: misrouting, stale data, injection, and privacy breaches.
- Documentation: living runbooks for operators and developers.

## Example Evaluation Rubric (Sketch)

- Groundedness: response must cite sources with correct spans.
- Completeness: covers all sub-questions with sufficient evidence.
- Safety: avoids policy violations and respects user roles.
- Efficiency: uses minimal steps and compute within budget.

## Roadmap 2025

- Structured Retrieval: growing use of SQL/graph alongside vectors.
- Lightweight Agents: task-specific policies over monolithic general agents.
- Verified Tooling: formal specs and fuzzing for critical automations.
- Privacy-Preserving RAG: confidential compute and selective disclosure.

## Closing Note

- The durable moat is reliable orchestration, not just model quality.
- Design for evaluation from day one; iterate with telemetry, not guesswork.

## Patterns in the Wild

- Ticket triage: agent retrieves runbooks, proposes fixes, and opens PRs in shadow mode.
- Sales enablement: hybrid RAG over product docs; tool calls to pricing and inventory APIs.
- Governance assistant: drafts safety cases using templates and links to evidence.

## Memory Design Details

- Short-term: windowed context with eviction tuned to dialog turn length.
- Long-term: embedding store with decay and importance scoring.
- Episodic: task-level snapshots of state for resume/replay.

## Tooling Quality Gates

- Schema validation: reject ambiguous inputs with friendly repair prompts.
- Rate limits: per tool and per user; burst and sustained controls.
- Sandboxes: read-only defaults; explicit grants for write actions.

## Human-in-the-Loop

- Review queues: surface low-confidence actions for approval.
- Annotation UX: capture corrections to improve retrieval and planning.
- Playbooks: standardized responses for common failure patterns.

## Deployment Footnotes

- Versioning: pin prompts, tools, and model variants per route.
- Rollback: keep last known-good bundle; switch via feature flags.
- Shadow traffic: mirror subset of real queries for evaluation.

## Additional Metrics

- Tool success rate: proportion of tool calls that return valid results.
- Plan efficiency: average steps-to-success per task category.
- Confidence calibration: correlation between model self-score and rubric score.

## Open Research Threads

- Automatic decomposition: learning to plan without hand-crafted heuristics.
- Safety under tool-use: preventing compound errors across steps.
- Non-text actions: UI grounding and recovery from partial failures.
